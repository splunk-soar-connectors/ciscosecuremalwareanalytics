    <li>
        The value for the '<b>vm</b>' parameter in the '<b>detonate file</b>' action is dynamic, so that the dropdown is removed from it. The list of available VMs can change from the ThreatGrid side. Run the '<b>list vms</b>' action to get the valid values for the '<b>vm</b>' parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some action data paths have been added/updated. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks.
