## Backward compatibility

-   The value for the ' **vm** ' parameter in the ' **detonate file** ' action is dynamic, so that
    the dropdown is removed from it. The list of available VMs can change from the ThreatGrid side.
    Run the ' **list vms** ' action to get the valid values for the ' **vm** ' parameter.
-   Some action data paths have been added/updated. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please
    update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding
    action blocks.

## Port Information
