<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>
    The value for the '<b>vm</b>' parameter in the '<b>detonate file</b>' action is dynamic, so that the dropdown is removed from it. The list of available VMs can change from the ThreatGrid side. Run the '<b>list vms</b>' action to get the valid values for the '<b>vm</b>' parameter.
</p>

<h2>Port Information</h2>
<p>
    The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the ThreatGrid server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
